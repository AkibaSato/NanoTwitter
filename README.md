## Usage
### Requirements
These are required for your local development environment:

* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Postgres Server](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [Redis](https://redis.io/)

### STEP 1: Clone the repositories
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/AkibaSato/NanoTwitter
$ git clone https://github.com/mgkbsh/ntUserService
$ git clone https://github.com/mgkbsh/ntTweetService
$ git clone https://github.com/mgkbsh/ntSearchService
$ git clone https://github.com/mgkbsh/ntWriteService

```

### STEP 2: Install the necessary modules
Run the following commands in each repo directory.
Install `sequelize` to global directory to just use `sequelize` prefix instead of specifying path name to binary for commands:
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm install -g sequelize-cli
```

### STEP 3: Start the Postgres server
Postgres directory might be: /usr/local/var/postgres
```sh
$ pg_ctl -D <Postgres directory> start
```

### STEP 4: Create the database on your local machine
```sh
$ sequelize db:migrate
```

### STEP 5: Run the app locally
Run every service with the following command.
```sh
$ node index.js
```
Point your browser to http://localhost:3000 and voila!

## Notes for developers
```sh
  sequelize db: [create/migrate/drop] --env [development/test]
```

### Local Development
To connect to the Postgres shell:
```sh
$ psql ntdev
```

#### Create migrations
First create a boilerplate migration and model file with the basic columns. This example creates a new model:
```sh
$ sequelize model:create --name User --attributes fname:string,bio:text
```

Further modify the migration file and model file if necessary. Any changes to either file must be reflected in the other manually.

To migrate:
```sh
$ sequelize db:migrate
```
If you want to undo the migration:
```
$ sequelize db:migrate:undo:all
```

### Heroku Deployment
To migrate Postgres models on Heroku:
```sh
$ heroku sequelize db:migrate --env production
```
Check results of change in Postgres shell.
```sh
$ heroku pg:psql
```

### Testing
To run tests, run:
npm test
